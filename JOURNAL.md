# June 16th: Research and Design!
I decided what features I wanted on my keyboard and tried to find the exact parts I would order according to the budget. I watched several videos on how to design a keyboard (some twice) and started to begin to understand what was going on. Hopefully.

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# June 17th: Starting the Schematic
I created the schematic for the base parts: the MCU, the switches and the diodes. I still need to add the OLED display, rotary encoder and LEDS. Although I initially wired it in a matrix that mirrors how the actual 88 keys would look on the keyboard, I found out that I could instead use any matrix, so I started again using a 10x9 matrix this time so I could save IO pins for the rest of the components.

**Total time spent: 2.5 hours**

# June 19th: Completed Schematic!
I finished the schematic (for now!)

# June 25th: Tried Routing the PCB...
Routed the PCB 4 times and it is still terrible. Will try again.

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# June 26th: Progress on the PCB
I think I've routed the PCB decently now though there are over 235 errors I need to deal with somehow.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# June 27th: PCB Might Actually be Getting Somwhere!
I've got rid of all the errors and it seems to be ok for now. I still need to figure out how to add stitching vias.

# June 28th: Starting the Case
I watched a ton of youtube videos on Fusion 360 and started following a tutorial on desining a case. Still need to decide what mounting style to go with.
