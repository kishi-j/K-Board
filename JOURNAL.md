# June 16th: Research and Design!
I decided what features I wanted on my keyboard and tried to find the exact parts I would order according to the budget. I watched several videos on how to design a keyboard (some twice) and started to begin to understand what was going on. Hopefully.

**Total time spent: 3hrs**

# June 17th: Starting the Schematic!
I created the schematic for the base parts: the MCU, the switches and the diodes. I still need to add the OLED display, rotary encoder and LEDS. Although I initially wired it in a matrix that mirrors how the actual 88 keys would look on the keyboard, I found out that I could instead use any matrix, so I started again using a 10x9 matrix this time so I could save IO pins for the rest of the components.

# June 17th: Completed Schematic!
I finished the schematic (for now!)
